## Vision Statement

ZEngine is a modern game engine built from the ground up for 2025+ hardware realities, targeting indie developers who want **maximum performance without complexity**. We reject the false choice between "easy to use" and "high performance" by leveraging Zig's compile-time capabilities to automatically generate highly optimized executables from simple, declarative game code.

## Why ZEngine?

### The Problem with Existing Engines

- **Single-threaded legacy**: Most engines waste 7/8 of available CPU cores
- **Poor memory patterns**: Object-oriented designs cause cache misses
- **Runtime overhead**: Dynamic dispatch and allocation during gameplay
- **One-size-fits-all**: Same engine binary for all hardware configurations

### ZEngine's Solution

- **Multi-core by default**: Automatic threading based on compile-time analysis
- **Cache-optimal memory**: Structure-of-Arrays layout for perfect cache locality  
- **Zero-overhead abstractions**: High-level APIs compile down to optimal machine code
- **Hardware-aware compilation**: Each binary targets specific hardware capabilities

## Core Philosophy

### Performance-First Design Principles

1. **Multi-core by Default**: Engines shouldn't waste 7/8 of available CPU cores
2. **Cache-Optimal Memory**: Memory layout optimized for cache hits, not programmer convenience  
3. **Zero-Overhead Abstractions**: High-level APIs compile down to optimal machine code
4. **Compile-Time Optimization**: Move complexity from runtime to compile-time
5. **Hardware-Aware Compilation**: Each binary targets specific hardware capabilities

### Developer Experience Principles

1. **Simple, Declarative APIs**: Game developers describe *what*, engine determines *how*
2. **Optimization Through Natural Design**: Good performance emerges from natural API usage
3. **Single Binary Model**: One optimized executable per game, no runtime engine bloat
4. **Indie-Focused**: Powerful enough for AAA, accessible enough for solo developers

## Technical Architecture

### The Five Subsystem Model

Every game fundamentally consists of five core subsystems:
- **Input**: Keyboard, mouse, gamepad handling
- **Logic**: Game state, AI, scripting
- **Physics**: Collision detection, dynamics, constraints  
- **Audio**: Sound effects, music, DSP processing
- **Render**: Graphics, shaders, post-processing

### Memory Architecture

**Problem**: Traditional engines have terrible cache performance due to:
- Object-oriented designs with scattered memory
- Dynamic allocation during gameplay
- Poor data locality

**Solution**: Structure-of-Arrays with compile-time layout optimization
- All game objects pre-allocated in cache-aligned arrays
- Components stored separately for perfect cache locality
- Zero malloc/free during gameplay execution

### Threading Model

**Problem**: Most engines are single-threaded or poorly threaded

**Solution**: Compile-time dependency analysis with automatic parallelization
- Analyze data dependencies at compile time
- Generate optimal execution plans for available cores
- Lock-free communication between systems
- Work-stealing for dynamic load balancing

## API Design

### Simple, Declarative Game Definition

```zig
pub const MyGame = struct {
    // Declarative entity specification
    entities: zengine.EntityCollection(.{
        .Player = .{ .max_count = 1 },
        .Enemy = .{ .max_count = 100 },
        .Bullet = .{ .max_count = 500 },
    }),
    
    // System configuration
    physics: zengine.PhysicsSystem(.{
        .collision_layers = .{ .player, .enemies, .bullets },
        .gravity = -9.8,
    }),
    
    renderer: zengine.RenderSystem(.{
        .max_sprites = 1000,
        .lighting = .simple,
    }),
    
    audio: zengine.AudioSystem(.{
        .max_voices = 32,
        .effects = .{ .reverb },
    }),
    
    // Simple game logic
    pub fn update(self: *MyGame, input: zengine.Input) !void {
        self.handleInput(input);
        self.updateEnemies();
        self.physics.step();
    }
    
    pub fn render(self: *MyGame) !void {
        self.renderer.drawSprites(self.entities.getAllSprites());
    }
};
```

### Behind-the-Scenes Optimization

The engine automatically generates:
- **Optimal memory layout** based on entity declarations
- **Threading strategies** based on data dependencies
- **Batch rendering calls** based on sprite usage patterns
- **SIMD-optimized loops** for entity updates
- **Hardware-specific code paths** for different GPU architectures

### Multi-Tier Hardware Support

Single API works across all hardware tiers:
- **Potato Tier**: Integrated graphics, 8GB RAM → Performance-focused optimizations
- **Mid-Range**: GTX 1060 class, 16GB RAM → Balanced optimizations  
- **High-End**: RTX 3070+ class, 32GB RAM → Quality-focused optimizations
- **Enthusiast**: RTX 4080+ class, 64GB+ RAM → Maximum quality optimizations

Runtime quality adaptation happens within compile-time allocated resource bounds.

## Key Innovations

### 1. SQL Execution Plan Approach for Games

Like database query optimizers, analyze game code to generate optimal execution plans:
- Identify resource bottlenecks at compile time
- Choose optimal algorithms based on data characteristics
- Generate hardware-specific optimizations

### 2. Resource Envelope Analysis

Define worst-case resource bounds at compile time:
- GPU memory usage analysis from shader complexity
- CPU cycle budgets from physics simulation requirements  
- Audio processing requirements from effect chain analysis
- Memory bandwidth requirements from data access patterns

### 3. Primitive Operation Framework

Break complex systems into analyzable primitives:
- **Render Operations**: Draw calls, compute dispatches, texture uploads
- **Physics Operations**: Collision detection, constraint solving, integration
- **Audio Operations**: Effect processing, mixing, format conversion

Each primitive has known performance characteristics that combine predictably.

### 4. Automatic Multi-Threading

Generate optimal threading strategies without manual work:
- Analyze data dependencies from game structure
- Determine which operations can run in parallel
- Generate work-stealing job queues for load balancing
- Optimize for cache locality across thread boundaries

### 5. Compile-Time Shader Analysis

Analyze shader complexity at compile time:
- Count arithmetic operations, texture samples, branches
- Estimate GPU memory bandwidth requirements
- Generate appropriate LOD and quality variants
- Optimize render passes for target hardware

## Performance Targets

### Frame Rate Goals
- **Minimum**: Consistent 60 FPS on mid-range hardware
- **Target**: Consistent 144 FPS on high-end hardware  
- **Stretch**: 240+ FPS on enthusiast hardware

### Memory Efficiency
- **Zero dynamic allocation** during gameplay
- **90%+ cache hit rate** for hot data paths
- **Perfect memory alignment** for SIMD operations
- **Hardware tier-specific** memory budgets

### CPU Utilization
- **100% utilization** of available cores during intensive scenes
- **Sub-1ms scheduling overhead** for job distribution
- **Lock-free communication** between systems
- **Automatic load balancing** across cores

### GPU Utilization  
- **Batched rendering** to minimize draw call overhead
- **Optimal GPU memory usage** based on hardware detection
- **Compute shader integration** for parallel processing
- **Asynchronous GPU/CPU execution**
